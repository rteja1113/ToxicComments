# ToxicComments
Some of the code used for Kaggle's Toxic Comment Classification Challenge(https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). Used PyTorch, torchtext for modeling and SpaCy for basic language processing.
The final submission was an ensemble of the below models trained with word2vec and GLoVe vectors.
1) A shallow CNN
2) A deep CNN
3) A character level CNN
4) LSTM
5) Bi-directional LSTM
6) GRU
